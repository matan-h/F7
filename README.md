# Slick Launcher - bad readme by gemini

Slick Launcher is a fast, keyboard-driven utility designed to help you quickly process text, execute commands, and automate tasks without interrupting your workflow. It pops up instantly, ready for your input, and works seamlessly with text you've selected in any application.

Forget hunting through menus or switching windows for simple actions. With Slick Launcher, your selected text becomes a dynamic input, and a simple command gets the job done, often copying the result directly back to your clipboard.

## Features

* **Quick Access:** Launch with a simple key combination and get immediate access to the input field.
* **Works with Selected Text:** Automatically grabs the text you have currently selected in another application, making it the subject of your actions.
* **Plugin Powered:** Its capabilities are extended through a flexible plugin system. Each plugin can understand specific commands or text patterns.
* **Live Preview:** See the potential output or result of your command *before* you execute it, right in the launcher window.
* **Smart Autocompletion:** Get suggestions as you type, helping you discover available commands and options within plugins.
* **Clipboard Integration:** Often, the result of an action is automatically copied to your clipboard, ready for you to paste.
* **Clean Interface:** A minimal, non-intrusive design that stays out of your way.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch:** Start the Slick Launcher application. You'll see a small, focused window appear, usually in the center of your screen.
2.  **Select Text (Optional):** In *any* other application, select the text you want to work with. When Slick Launcher is active, it will automatically pick up this selected text.
3.  **Type Your Command:** In the input field of the Slick Launcher, start typing. You can type:
    * Just text you want to process.
    * A command, often starting or ending with a specific character or word depending on the installed plugins (e.g., `!search`, `translate to fr:`).
4.  **See the Preview:** As you type, the area below the input field will update, showing you what the active plugin intends to do or the potential result.
5.  **Use Autocompletion:** If the active plugin supports it, press `Ctrl + Space` to trigger autocompletion suggestions based on what you've typed. Use the arrow keys to navigate and `Tab` or `Enter` to select a suggestion.
6.  **Execute:** Once the preview looks right (or if there's no preview), press `Enter` to execute the command or action.
7.  **Get Results:** If the plugin produces a result (like a calculation or translated text), it might be automatically copied to your clipboard. The status bar will often give you feedback.
8.  **Dismiss:** The launcher will typically close automatically after execution or if you press `Escape` (unless the autocompletion popup is open, in which case press `Escape` again). It also hides if you switch focus away from it.

<!-- ## Installation

*(Instructions for installing Python, PyQt6, and placing the code and plugins will go here.)*

1.  Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2.  Install the PyQt6 library:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt6
    ```
3.  Install any necessary libraries for the plugins you want to use (refer to plugin documentation).
4.  Save the code provided as `slick_launcher.py`.
5.  Create a `plugins` directory in the same location and add your plugin files there.
6.  Run the launcher:
    ```bash
    python slick_launcher.py
    ``` -->

## Customization & Plugins

Slick Launcher's power comes from its plugins. You can extend its functionality by adding new plugins to the `plugins` directory. Each plugin can define how it handles input, what previews it shows, and what action it performs upon execution.

*(Optional: Briefly mention where users can find or how they can create plugins if applicable.)*
